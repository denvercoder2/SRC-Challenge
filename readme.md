## Challenge
---
This little program is something I wrote to mimic the esoteric nature of brainf*ck ( I don't know if I should throw the F-word in this project, ya know since all these fine people can see it)

If you're unfamiliar with it, here's a little intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdHjjBS4cs8


This code was written just as a side project for fun, but I figured I'd make it interesting.


The first person to reach out to me and have working input that returns the phrase "I solved it, now give me my free lunch!" will be treated to a free lunch from me, to the place of your choosing. Everyone who is reading this is welcome to participate. 

Some Rules:

1. There are in fact **multiple** solutions to this problem, the solution that is the **least** number of characters wins, if two people tie and the answers are different, then you both get a lunch.

## How to actually run this code
- Have a python version compatable: < 3 or above
- Change however you want to run it, but generally 
```bash
python3 bf.py # or make it executable using chmod +x and adding a shebang to the top of the file
